 The Four Minarets, also known as Charminar, is another monument built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty. 
 There are many folklores about the true origin of this building with some suggesting that the
 structure was built to mark the end of an extremely deadly Cholera. Charminar is a square structure made of 
 granite, pulverized marble, mortar and limestone 
 and is known for its balustrades, balconies and stucco decorations. The four minarets that are 56-meters
 tall stand at each corner of the main structure. Each minaret has a double balcony, and there are 149 
 steps to reach the upper floor. There is a mosque on the top floor of the four-storied Charminar.
